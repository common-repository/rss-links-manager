Manage and customise your RSS feed links.

== Description ==

RSS Links Manager lets you easily customise your RSS links via WordPress' admin menu. Are you using Feedburner? Just enter your Feedburner URL. Are you using Disqus or Facebook comments instead of WordPress' internal comment system? Just deactivate the feeds you don't need - including category, tag and author feeds.

Features:

*   Customise your feed links (title, URL, MIME type)
*   Remove individual feed links (main feed, comments, extras)
*   Directly hooks into WordPress' wp_head functon
*   Multilingual (English and German)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full directory into your plugins folder (e.g. wp-content/plugins/)
